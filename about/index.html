<div class="blurb">
	<p>I work as a software engineer in the Chicago area, with a focus on website search/navigation and applied statistics.<br>
     I'm originally from Cleveland, OH, and have lived at various points in Sri Lanka Korea, Turkey, Princeton, and Bucks County, PA. <br> 
     In my free time, I'm a devoted book reader, board game player, hiker, and music lover.
